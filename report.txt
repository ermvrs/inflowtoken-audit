NOTE : Gas optimization recommendations removed because of project deploy target is Polygon chain.

PriceConsumerV3.sol
## LOGIC ##
 -> Gets price for MATIC / USD pair

## Recommendations ##
    -> Instead of using off-chain oracle fed smart contract, get direct token price from highest liquidity locked DeFi will be much more accurate on-chain.


InflowToken.sol
## LOGIC ##
    -> Simple ERC20 token with infinite minting.

## Vulnerabilities ##
    -> Owner can mint new tokens with calling mintToken function anytime he/she wants.
    -> If owner private key stolen, the exploiter can mint tokens.

## Recommendations ##
    -> (mintToken function) Adding require statement that checks the caller is owner and also the caller is contract.
    -> With first recommendations, transfer owner of the contract to the multi-sig wallet to prevent from key steal.


InflowPrivateSale.sol

## Recommendations ##

    Line 35: The initial value of boolean variable is already false, so redefining as false is non sense here. (INFORMATION)
    Line 38: Instead of defining variable as private and create a getter view function, variable can just be defined as public. (INFORMATION)
    Line 46: Variable named 'usedWhitelistSigs' has no visibility argument. (INFORMATION)
    Line 41: Setting admin wallet variable as private will not protect 3rd party from reading that value. It can be reachable with contract bytecode at fourth storage slot. (INFORMATION)
    Line 112: Instead of checking 'token' parameters address. You can change parameter type of token from 'address' to 'IERC20'. (INFORMATION)
    Line 137: Instead of setting inflowtoken price in function. Set it as global constant variable. (INFORMATION)
    Line 138: We assumed that '_maticUsd' parameter is used to get latest price of matic. It can be entered by user who calls 'buyTokens' function. If parameter set higher than MATIC price.
                User will be able to buy tokens with close to zero price.
    Line 156: Using struct as on mapping 'holderMap' is unnecessary. You can just define holder values with address => uint256 mapping. (INFORMATION)
    Line 160: Returning value from non callable from contract function is unnecessary. (INFORMATION)
    Line 513: Block.timestamp can be abused by block miners. Using block.number is much secure. (INFORMATION)
    Line 279: Require statement for '_duration' parameter is unnecessary. It was set as constant on 'buyTokens' function. (INFORMATION)
    Line 169: If owner of InflowToken.sol and InflowPrivateSale.sol contracts will be same. The Private sale contract should sign newly added users messages off-chain to 
            let them be able to buy the token, and that means owner key can be accesible from off-chain oracle or a person. Vulnerability on off-chain oracle can also cause minting infinite tokens.
            Recommendation is use seperate wallets for signing ECDSA and minting Inflow Tokens (Low Severity)
